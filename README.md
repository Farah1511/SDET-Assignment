 # Issue faced
This was my first attempt at automation testing, and overall, it was a great learning experience. I encountered several challenges along the way, but I was able to resolve most of them successfully with the help of Google and AI tools. While I aimed to achieve 100% accuracy, I understand that perfection is a continuous journey.
One of the major challenges I faced was with API testing, particularly while working with the OpenWeather API. Despite generating multiple API keys, every request resulted in a 401 Unauthorized error. To troubleshoot, I:
•	Regenerated the API key multiple times.
•	Ensured the key was correctly implemented in the request.
•	Checked for activation delays and API access restrictions.
•	Sought help from ChatGPT and other online resources.
Unfortunately, the issue remains unresolved, and I was unable to retrieve valid responses from the API. However, I have documented my efforts and approach in my submission.
I truly hope that my dedication and problem-solving efforts will be recognized. Given the opportunity to work under the supervision of experienced SQA Engineers, I am confident that I can further enhance my skills and contribute effectively. I look forward to learning and growing in a professional environment.
